Below are some books I've read or like but is by no means comprehensive. To see that and what I'm currently reading, I occasionally update my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68725952-newton). There is almost always something in progress from the [Western Canon](https://newtonkwan.com/westerncanon/).
