Hi, I'm Newton! I am a Software Engineer working on AI for drug discovery at GSK (formerly known as GlaxoSmithKline). Previously, I was a Software Engineer on the Analytics team at Zume. I received my Masters in Machine Learning at the University College London (UCL) under the supervision of Tim Rocktäschel and Jakob Foerster, where I studied reinforcement learning for social dilemmas. As an undergraduate, I was a member of the Duke Neutrino and Cosmology Group and Duke ATLAS and the Musical Director for Something Borrowed Something Blue, and  - in another life - a bassoonist in the Stephen Paulson Bassoon Studio at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. I became interested in artificial intelligence in 2018, when I received my Bachelors of Science from the Department of Physics at Duke University under the supervision of Kate Scholberg and Alexander Hartemink. 

Like my background, my interests are broad. Current high level projects include:

- machine learning, particularly reinforcement learning, open-endedness, and AI for drug discovery 

I have done earlier work in:

- reinforcement learning for social dilemmas 
- building data pipelines for large corpuses of data
- effects of supernova neutrinos on dark matter detectors
- direct dark matter detection at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)

## Projects
Last Updated: Dec. 22, 2024

I want to help develop artificial intelligence to solve important problems.  Projects help me hone my skills in software engineering, machine learning, and different tools.
