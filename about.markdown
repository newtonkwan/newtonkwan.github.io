I am a Software Engineer working on [AI/ML](https://gsk.ai/) for drug discovery at [GSK](https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/). Previously, I was a Software Engineer on the Analytics team at Zume. I received my Masters in Machine Learning at the [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [Tim Rocktäschel](https://rockt.ai/) and [Jakob Foerster](https://www.jakobfoerster.com/) as a member of [UCL DARK](https://ucldark.com/), where I studied deep reinforcement learning. As an undergraduate, I was a member of the [Duke Neutrino and Cosmology Group](http://neutrino.phy.duke.edu/) and [Duke ATLAS](http://atlas.phy.duke.edu/), the Musical Director for [Something Borrowed Something Blue](https://www.dukesbsb.com/), and  - in another life - a bassoonist in the [Stephen Paulson](https://www.sfsymphony.org/Data/Event-Data/Artists/P/Stephen-Paulson) Bassoon Studio at the [San Francisco Conservatory of Music](https://sfcm.edu/). I became interested in artificial intelligence in 2018, when I received my Bachelors of Science from the [Department of Physics](https://physics.duke.edu/) at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) under the supervision of [Kate Scholberg](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/schol) and [Alexander Hartemink](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~amink/). 

Like my background, my interests are broad. Current high level projects include:

- machine learning, particularly reinforcement learning, open-endedness, and AI for drug discovery 

I have done earlier work in:

- reinforcement learning for social dilemmas 
- building data pipelines for large corpuses of data
- effects of supernova neutrinos on dark matter detectors
- direct dark matter detection at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)

## Projects
Last Updated: Dec. 22, 2024

I want to help develop artificial intelligence to solve important problems.  Projects help me hone my skills in software engineering, machine learning, and different tools.
